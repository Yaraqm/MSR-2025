**Conference Submission:** [Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2025]

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for the paper titled **"Your Paper Title"** submitted to **[Conference Name]**. This code is designed to reproduce the experiments and results presented in the paper, providing a full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Main source code for the project.
- `data/`: Scripts and files for data preprocessing.
- `models/`: Model definitions and checkpoints (if available).
- `experiments/`: Configurations and scripts for running experiments.
- `results/`: Output files and logs from experiment runs.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, or analysis.
- `README.md`: Repository documentation.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: See `requirements.txt` for a full list of dependencies.
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**Optional**: Additional setup steps or dependencies for specific sections (e.g., GPU setup or specific data sources).

## Data Preparation
1. Download the dataset:
   - Instructions on where to obtain the data (e.g., links to data sources).
2. Preprocess the data:
   - Run the following command to preprocess the dataset:
     ```bash
     python data/preprocess.py --input_path data/raw --output_path data/processed
     ```

## Usage
### Training
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the model on test data, run:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/checkpoint.pt --data_path data/processed/test
```

### Reproducing Results
For reproducibility, all experiment configurations used in the paper are saved in the `experiments/` directory. Use these configurations to reproduce the experiments with the following command:
```bash
python src/run_experiment.py --config experiments/experiment1.yaml
```

## Results
The main results, including metrics and figures, can be found in the `results/` directory. For further details, refer to our paper.
